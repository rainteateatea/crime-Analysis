This is readme of Montreal-Crime-Analysis.

System Environment: macOS Catalina/Version 10.15
Python3 Version: Python3.6.5

Including File: a_star.py(basic) bonus(advanced).

Heuristic Method: Manhattan Distance, Euclidean Distance

At the very beginning, please check read file path on each python file.

Run: Open shell->input python3 a_star.py/bnous.py 
The project will run.

Start Step(a_star.py):
1. Input the size of grid and threshold on command line
2. Input the heuristic method
3. After above inputs, the project will show total number of crime in each grid, average and standard deviation of all grids.
4. Except these information, it will also show 2 figure. The first one is crime rates graph, the other one is optimal path on crimes rates graph
5. Finally, the console will show the process time.      

Start Step(bonus.py):  
1. Same as start step of a_star.py, input every useful information by command line.
2. Except these information, input start coordinate and end coordinate.
3. The system will show same graphs as basic one. On the other hand, these graphs indicate the map of Montreal.
4. Finally, system will show overall process time.
